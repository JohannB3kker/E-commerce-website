# E-commerce-website
This project is an e-commerce website which I built during my BSc IT degree. I met with the owner of The Biltong Pantry and built her this e-commerce website. The Biltong Pantry is a business which sells various meat products. This website enables the business to generate online sales. Customers are able to create an account, browse products, add products to a cart, checkout products and order products. The manager is able to browse products, add products, edit products, edit orders and view orders. 

This e-commerce website is linked to a database. All products are displayed from the database and orders that are placed are added to the database. Also, all changes made to products by administrators are reflected in the database.

The project consists of three deliverables: the project proposal, documentation and the user manual
